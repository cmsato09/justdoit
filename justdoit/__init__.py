    Don't let your dreams be dreams.
    Yesterday, you said tomorrow.

    Just DO IT.

    Some people dream of success, while you're gonna wake up and work HARD at it.
    Nothing is impossible.
    You should get to the point where anyone else would quit, and you're not gonna stop there.

    DO IT!
    Just DO IT!
    Yes you can.
    Just do it.
